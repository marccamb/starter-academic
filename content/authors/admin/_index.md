My main interest is the understanding of the multiple and complex interactions existing between a host, and its associated microorganisms. These microorganisms can either be pathogens or members of the host microbiota and potentially interact with each other. Interactions between microorganisms or with the host can vary with environmental conditions, and impact the ecology and evolution of all partners. I have been using a combination of lab experiments, field sampling and microbial community single gene profiling, on insect and plant hosts.
