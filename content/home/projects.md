# Next-Generation Biomonitoring of forest health

This project aims at finding bioindicators of tree drought stress using environmental DNA. We investigated the potential signature of tree water stress in leaf microbiota using single gene community profiling.
We then used machine learning techniques to predict tree water stress from their leaf microbiota composition. This project is part of the [ANR project NGB](https://anr.fr/Projet-ANR-17-CE32-0011).

# Heterogeneity within infections

This project adresses multiple sources of heterogeneity during a pathogenic infection. We first investigated within-host evolution of an insect pathogen (heterogeneity in the pathogen population) as well as interactions between the pathogen and the microbiota of its host (heterogeneity in the total bacterial population).
* PhD supervisors: Jean-Baptiste Ferdy and Sophie Gaudriault
