abstract: The plant endosphere is colonized by complex microbial communities
  and microorganisms, which colonize the plant interior at least part of their lifetime
  and are termed endophytes. Their functions range from mutualism to pathogenicity.
  All plant organs and tissues are generally colonized by bacterial endophytes and
  their diversity and composition depend on the plant, the plant organ and its physiological
  conditions, the plant growth stage as well as on the environment. Plant-associated
  microorganisms, and in particular endophytes, have lately received high attention,
  because of the increasing awareness of the importance of host-associated microbiota
  for the functioning and performance of their host. Some endophyte functions are
  known from mostly lab assays, genome prediction and few metagenome analyses; however,
  we have limited understanding on in planta activities, particularly considering
  the diversity of micro-environments and the dynamics of conditions. In our review,
  we present recent findings on endosphere environments, their physiological conditions
  and endophyte colonization. Furthermore, we discuss microbial functions, the interaction
  between endophytes and plants as well as methodological limitations of endophyte
  research. We also provide an outlook on needs of future research to improve our
  understanding on the role of microbiota colonizing the endosphere on plant traits
  and ecosystem functioning.
