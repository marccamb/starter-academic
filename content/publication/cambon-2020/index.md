abstract: 'The host microbiota may have an impact on pathogens. This is often studied
  in laboratory-reared hosts but rarely in individuals whose microbiota looks like
  that of wild animals. In this study, we modified the gut microbiota of the insect
  *Tenebrio molitor* by rearing larvae in soil sampled from the field. We showed by
  high throughput sequencing methods that this treatment modifies the gut microbiota
  so that it is more diversified than that of laboratory-reared insects, and closely
  resembled the one of soil-dwelling insects. To describe what the entomopathogenic
  bacterial symbiont *Xenorhabdus* (Enterobacteriaceae), vectored by the soil-dwelling
  nematode *Steinernema*, might experience in natural conditions, we studied the infestation
  of the soil-reared *T. molitor* larvae with three *Steinernema-Xenorhabdus* pairs. We
  performed the infestation at 18°C, which delays the emergence of new infective juveniles
  (IJs), the soil-dwelling nematode forms, but which is a temperature compatible with
  natural infestation. We analyzed by high throughput sequencing methods the composition
  of the bacterial community within the insect cadavers before the first emergences
  of IJs. These bacterial communities were generally characterized by one or two non-symbiont
  taxa. Even for highly lethal *Steinernema-Xenorhabdus* pairs, the symbiont does not
  dominate the bacterial community within the insect cadaver.'
